# Portfolio
This repository contains the record of my projects, which are mostly related to machine learning. <br>
These project represent my learning journey and exemplify my improvement over time. <br>

<b> Following is the list of my projects as submitted in this repository </b> <br>

    - Sudoku Solver (Backtracking algorithm)
    - Wordle Solver 
    - Tic Tac Toe (Mini-max algorithm)
    - Implementation of optimization algorithms with 3D plots (Momentum, NAG, AdaGrad, RMSprop, Adam with batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent)
          - On convex function (linear regression)
          - On non-convex function (Styblinski-Tang function)
    - Movie Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering)
    - Feed-forward Neural Net Framework 
    - Handwritten Digit Classification (Neural Networks)
    - Simple and Hard Pong playing program (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
    - Implementation of decision trees and tree ensembles (Simple Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boost for Classification and Regression)
    - Disease classification using various classification techniques - 
          - Breast Cancer Classification
          - Heart Disease Classification
          - Diabetes Classification (using imputation with Random Forest)

No machine learning framework or library has been used in any of these projects for the implementation of the key functionalities. The machine learning algorithms are written from scratch.
